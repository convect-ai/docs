## Background

This tutorial walks through how to utilize Convect Automated Forecasting API to finish the [M5 Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy) challenge.


## Prepare the data 

Because the M5 data is in the *wide format*, we first need to convert them to the regular format as specified in [data preparation section](../forecast/data-prepare.md).

```python
{! m5/data-prepare.py !}
```

## Run the forecasts
Once we have the data split by store, we can build a model for each store level dataset.

```python
{! m5/run-forecast.py !}
```


## Combine the results
Once all the models finish, we can read and combine all the store level results, post-process them in the format ready for submission to Kaggle.

```python
{! m5/combine-result.py !}
```
